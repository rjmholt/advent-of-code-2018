===

Having a crack at 2018's Advent of Code in Rust.

To build:

```
cargo build
```

This will place the executable at `./target/debug/advent-of-code`.
Run the puzzles from that `debug` directory.

To run all puzzles:

```
./advent-of-code
```

To run, for example, day 3 puzzle 2 and day 1 puzzle 1:

```
./advent-of-code 3_2 1_1
```

For more help:

```
./advent-of-code --help
```
